# HelloWorld
This is an alternative "Blink" Arduino sketch for Amateur Radio operators and Ham Geeks

## KD8VON says Hello World
Hello from KD8VON.  The standard Arduino blink sketch used to confirm your Arduino board is working is just too boring.  Being an Amateur Radio Geek I wrote this sketch to blink hello world out in Morse code.

Who knows Morse code?  Some amateur radio operator, some pilots and a few Geeks like me.

## Dedication
This video and sketch are dedicated to Harvey Ernst who introduced me to Ham radio and electronics back when I was 13. Thank you.
